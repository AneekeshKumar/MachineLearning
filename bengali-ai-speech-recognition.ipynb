recognition (ASR) using a pre-trained language model (LM), and returns the predicted text from the speech. However, there are a few undefined variables and functions in the code that need clarification to understand the entire process. I'll explain the code step-by-step:\n\n1. `librosa.load(audio_path, sr=processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate)`: This line uses the librosa library to load the audio file specified by `audio_path` and returns the audio waveform `speech` and the sample rate `sr`. The `processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate` seems to be a variable or attribute that holds the desired sampling rate for the audio.\n\n2. `my_asrLM(speech)`: It seems like `my_asrLM` is a custom function that performs automatic speech recognition using a pre-trained language model. The input to this function is the `speech`, which is the audio waveform loaded in the previous step. This function might internally use a language model specifically trained for ASR to convert the speech into text.\n\n3. `my_LM_prediction['text']`: Assuming `my_asrLM` returns a dictionary containing various information about the ASR prediction, this line retrieves the recognized text from the ASR prediction result.\n\nBased on the provided code snippet, I can't determine the specific details of the `my_asrLM` function or the `processor.feature_extractor.sampling_rate` attribute since they are not defined in the snippet. If you can provide more context or the implementation of these functions/variables, I can help you further with the ASR inference process.\n\n\"\"\";","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.021069,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:40.970046","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:40.948977","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.101791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.106584Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.117987Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.10655Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.117094Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def batch_infer(audio_paths, batch_size=BATCH_SIZE):\n    '''\n    infers on a batch of audio\n    args:\n      audio_paths  : list of path to audio files <list of string>\n    returns:\n      bangla predicted texts <list of string>\n    '''\n    results = []\n    for path in audio_paths:\n        pred = \"\"\n        try:\n            pred = infer(path)\n        except:\n            pred = \"爬十"\n        if len(pred)==0:\n            pred = \"爬十"\n        results.append(pred)\n    \n    return results\n\n\"\"\"\nThe provided code snippet defines a function named `batch_infer`, which performs inference on a batch of audio files using the `infer` function (assuming that the `infer` function is defined elsewhere in the code, and it processes a single audio file to obtain a predicted text).

The `infer` function is assumed to be implemented elsewhere in the code and is responsible for processing a single audio file and returning the predicted text.

Let's break down each function:\n\n1. `normalize(sen)`: This function takes a Bengali sentence as input (`sen`) and returns the normalized version of the sentence. The normalization process seems to involve using the `bnunicodenormalizer` library to normalize individual words within the sentence. The function iterates through each word in the sentence, normalizes it using the `bnunicodenormalizer` library, and then joins the normalized words back into a normalized sentence. The normalized sentence will have normalized characters (e.g., combining characters) for proper rendering.\n\n   However, there's a small issue in the function. In the list comprehension used to normalize each word (`_words`), the normalization is attempted for every word, even if it contains characters that are not Bengali. The `bnunicodenormalizer` library is designed to work with Bengali text, so using it on non-Bengali characters may lead to unintended behavior or errors. If the input sentence contains non-Bengali characters, it's better to handle those cases explicitly.\n\n2. `dari(sentence)`: This function takes a Bengali sentence as input (`sentence`). It checks if the sentence ends with a Bengali full stop (U+09爭､ - DARI). If the sentence does not end with the full stop, it appends one at the end. The purpose of this function seems to ensure that the Bengali sentence ends with the appropriate punctuation.\n\n   The function includes a `try-except` block, which is not necessary for this specific case. The code inside the `try` block simply checks the last character of the sentence. If the last character is not a full stop (DARI), it appends one. If the last character is already a full stop, no error will occur. Therefore, the `try-except` block is redundant, and the code can be simplified to just the `if` statement.\n\nIt is important to note that the code relies on an external library `bnunicodenormalizer`, which is used for Bengali Unicode normalization. Ensure that you have installed this library and imported it correctly for the code to work as intended. Additionally, the code may not handle all edge cases and may need further refinement depending on the specific use case.\n\"\"\";","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.031291,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.045913","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.014622","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.145828Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.146462Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.176097Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.146386Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.174932Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def post_process_keys(str):\n    return str.replace(\"../input/test-wav-files-dl-sprint/test_files_wav/\",\"\").replace(\".wav\",\".mp3\")\n\n\"\"\"\nThe function `post_process_keys(str)` appears to be a post-processing function designed to modify and clean up file paths or keys (strings) related to audio files.\n\nLet's break down the function:\n\n1. `str.replace(\"../input/test-wav-files-dl-sprint/test_files_wav/\", \"\")`: This line of code replaces the substring `../input/test-wav-files-dl-sprint/test_files_wav/` with an empty string in the input `str`. This is essentially removing the specified prefix from the string.\n\n2. `.replace(\".wav\", \".mp3\")`: After removing the prefix in the previous step, this line replaces the substring `.wav` with `.mp3` in the remaining string. This is essentially changing the file extension of the audio file from WAV to MP3.\n\nThe purpose of this function seems to be converting file paths or keys of WAV audio files to corresponding MP3 file paths or keys, possibly for further processing or handling of the audio data.\n\nIt is important to note that modifying file paths or keys using string replacement can be error-prone, especially if the paths are not in the exact format expected by the function. Ensure that the input `str` matches the expected format, or consider adding error handling to handle unexpected inputs more gracefully. Additionally, if this function is used in a larger codebase, it's a good practice to choose a more descriptive name for the function than `post_process_keys` to reflect its specific purpose.\n\"\"\";","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019237,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.076573","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.057336","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.18071Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.181352Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.19096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.18132Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.190032Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def directory_infer(audio_dir):\n    '''\n    infers on a directory that contains audio files\n    args:\n      audio_dir  : directory that contains some audio files <string>\n    returns:\n      a dataframe that contains 2 columns:\n        * path <string>\n        * sentence <string>\n    '''\n    # list all audio files\n\n    audio_paths=[audio_path for audio_path in tqdm(glob(os.path.join(audio_dir,\"*.*\")))]\n    files = os.listdir(\"/kaggle/input/bengaliai-speech/test_mp3s\")\n    paths = []\n    for i in files:\n        paths.append(i.split(\".\")[0])\n    sentences=[]\n    for idx in tqdm(range(0,len(audio_paths),BATCH_SIZE)):\n        batch_paths=audio_paths[idx:idx+BATCH_SIZE]\n        sentences+=batch_infer(batch_paths)\n        \n    df= pd.DataFrame({\"id\":paths,\"sentence\":sentences})\n    df.sentence= df.sentence.apply(lambda x:normalize(x))\n    #df.sentence= df.sentence.apply(lambda x:dari(x))\n    df['id'] = df['id'].apply(lambda x: post_process_keys(x))\n    \n    return df \n\"\"\"\nThe function `directory_infer(audio_dir)` performs inference on a directory that contains audio files.

The \"id\" values are then appended to the `paths` list.\n\n6. `sentences = []`: Initializes an empty list named `sentences` to store the predicted sentences from the ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model.\n\n7. `for idx in tqdm(range(0, len(audio_paths), BATCH_SIZE)):`: This loop iterates through the `audio_paths` list in batches of size `BATCH_SIZE` (assuming `BATCH_SIZE` is defined elsewhere).\n\n8. `batch_paths = audio_paths[idx:idx + BATCH_SIZE]`: Extracts a batch of audio file paths from `audio_paths`.\n\n9. `sentences += batch_infer(batch_paths)`: Calls the `batch_infer` function with the current batch of audio file paths and adds the predicted sentences to the `sentences` list.\n\n10. `df = pd.DataFrame({\"id\": paths, \"sentence\": sentences})`: Creates a DataFrame (`df`) using the \"id\" values from step 5 and the predicted sentences obtained from ASR in step 9.\n\n11. `df.sentence = df.sentence.apply(lambda x: normalize(x))`: Applies the `normalize` function to each sentence in the \"sentence\" column of the DataFrame. This function normalizes Bengali sentences, as explained in a previous response.\n\n12. `df['id'] = df['id'].apply(lambda x: post_process_keys(x))`: Applies the `post_process_keys` function to each \"id\" value in the DataFrame. This function modifies the \"id\" values, as explained in a previous response.\n\n13. `return df`: The function returns the DataFrame `df`, which contains the \"id\" and \"sentence\" columns with the processed data.\n\nIt is important to note that the provided code references `BATCH_SIZE`, which is not defined in the given snippet. For this code to work correctly, `BATCH_SIZE` should be defined earlier in the code or imported from an external module. Additionally, some parts of the code (e.g., the lines related to `files`) appear to be specific to a Kaggle environment and may need modification if used in a different context.\n\"\"\";","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024482,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.112335","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.087853","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.194299Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.196025Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.220367Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.195993Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.2192Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = directory_infer(TEST_DIRECTORY)\nsubmission.head()","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":11.925018,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.049024","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:41.124006","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.224615Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.226877Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.791527Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:17.226827Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.790543Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def check(sentence):\n    if len(sentence)==0:\n        return '爭､'\n    return sentence","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.022292,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.086055","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.063763","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.792936Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.793815Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.801588Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.793778Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.800581Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission.sentence = submission.sentence.apply(lambda x:check(x))","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020792,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.11902","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.098228","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.802882Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.803797Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.812767Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.803761Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.811703Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission.to_csv(\"submission.csv\", index=False)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.024592,"end_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.156483","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-26T05:38:53.131891","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.814152Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.814773Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.826249Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.814738Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-01T02:26:30.825248Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### This notebook is a fork of [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mbmmurad/lb-0-506-inference-w-previous-comp-winner-s-model/notebook).\n\n汳裕his notebook has made some annotations on the original code.
